# Coursera week3 project "run_analysis"

## Target of this project: 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The upload files with the data are stored in the working directory of the R-file "run_analysis.R".
